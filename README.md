# AI Book Recommender
Apply machine learning to recommend books based on Goodreads user rating

In order to run, you must unzip the table.zip and book_model.zip files in the directory. Note that the table.zip will be very large when unzipped (over 4GB). Furthermore, move the unzipped files into a directory called "data" in backend. In addition, on the command line in this projects directory, run "pip install -r requirements.txt".
